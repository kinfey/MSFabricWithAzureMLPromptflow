If the column name is different, please replace `'Product Type'` with the actual column name.\n\nAlso note that the path to the CSV file in Azure ML is not a typical file path and can't be directly used with `pd.read_csv()`. The path should be a local path or a URL. If your data is in Azure ML, you would first need to download the file or read it using Azure ML-specific code."
